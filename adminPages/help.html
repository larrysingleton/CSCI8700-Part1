				style="color: #FFFFFF; font-family: 'Comic Sans MS'; font-size: 21px;">WHY
				ENGLISH IS SO HARD&nbsp; <br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>We'll begin with a box, and the plural is boxes,<br>But
				the plural of ox becomes oxen, not oxes.<br>One fowl is a
				goose, but two are called geese,<br>Yet the plural of moose
				should never be meese.<br>You may find a lone mouse or a nest
				full of mice,<br>Yet the plural of house is houses, not hice.<br>
			<br>
			<br>If the plural of man is always called men,<br>Why
				shouldn't the plural of pan be called pen?<br>If I speak of my
				foot and show you my feet,<br>And I give you a boot, would a
				pair be called beet?<br>If one is a tooth and a whole set are
				teeth,<br>Why shouldn't the plural of booth be called beeth?<br>
			<br>
			<br>Then one may be that, and three would be those,<br>Yet
				hat in the plural would never be hose,<br>And the plural of cat
				is cats, not cose.<br>We speak of a brother and also of
				brethren,<br>But though we say mother, we never say methren.<br>Then
				the masculine pronouns are he, his and him,<br>But imagine the
				feminine: she, shis and shim!<br>
			<br>
			<br>Let's face it - English is a crazy language.<br>There
				is no egg in eggplant nor ham in hamburger;<br>neither apple
				nor pine in pineapple.<br>English muffins weren't invented in
				England.<br>We take English for granted, but if we explore its
				paradoxes, we find<br>that quicksand can work slowly, boxing
				rings are square, and a guinea<br>pig is neither from Guinea
				nor is it a pig.<br>
			<br>
			<br>And why is it that writers write but fingers don't fing,
				grocers don't<br>groce and hammers don't ham?<br>
			<br>
			<br>Doesn't it seem crazy that you can make amends but not one
				amend.If<br>you have a bunch of odds and ends and get rid of
				all but one of them, what do<br>you call it?<br>
			<br>
			<br>If teachers taught, why didn't preachers praught?<br>If
				a vegetarian eats vegetables, what does a humanitarian eat?<br>
			<br>
			<br>Sometimes I think all the folks who grew up speaking English
				should be<br>committed to an asylum for the verbally insane.<br>
			<br>
			<br>In what other language do people recite at a play and play
				at a recital?<br>We ship by truck but send cargo by ship.<br>We
				have noses that run and feet that smell.<br>We park in a
				driveway and drive in a parkway.<br>And how can a slim chance
				and a fat chance be the same, while a wise<br>man and a wise
				guy are opposites?<br>
			<br>
			<br>You have to marvel at the unique lunacy of a language in
				which your<br>house can burn up as it burns<br>down, in
				which you fill in a form by filling it out,<br>and in which an
				alarm goes off by going on.<br>
			<br>
			<br>And, in closing, if Father is Pop, how come Mother's not
				Mop?<br>
			<br>
			<br>That's all for now.
